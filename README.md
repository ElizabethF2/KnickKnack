KnickKnack is a toy programming language and accompanying language runtime. It is designed to be embedded within a game engine running on older, resource constrained game systems such as the Nintendo DS. It includes a garbage collector. The runtime dynamically loads modules and compiles them to machine code as functions from said modules are called and will unload them when memory is needed, which results in KnickKnack code having both a small memory footprint and a fast runtime speed. KnickKnack code can be called from C/C++ code and vice-versa. The current implementation runs on the Nintendo DS (ARM9), Windows (x86) and Linux (x86) with other platforms potentially planned for the future. 

This readme is a stub. Full documentation and a license will be added in the future. See the current comments and code for info regarding setup and usage.
